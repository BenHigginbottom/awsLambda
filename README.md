Allows for the creation of any number of subdomains under a master record by being called via the API Gateway into a Lambda backend
Runs with 128Mb of memory and a 10 second timeout

Twit_QEAircraft.py :
Abandoned twitter bot that was started for UKDJ and TheOtherChris, when we got sick of the "Queen Elizabeth doesnt have any Aircraft" nonsense.
